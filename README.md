## Securing the Container Supply Chain with Snyk, ORAS and Gatekeeper (OPA)

This demo showcases how to use [Snyk](snyk.io) sbom test feature alongside [ORAS](oras.land) can be used to automate and ensure auditability and provenance of container build artifacts, by attaching sboms and vulnerability reports as referring artifacts to container images. Additionally, when storing our sboms and vulnerability scan results as artifacts in an OCI-compliant registry, we can use kubernetes admission controllers, defined by Gatekeeper (OPA) and Ratify to ensure that only images with valid SBOM's/Vulnerability Scans are deployed to a Kubernetes environments. Finally, storing sboms and vulnerability scan results, as well as the container image itself in our registry makes it the single source of truth for our software provenance artifacts, easing regulatory compliance and data-retention concerns.

The [snyk container sbom](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/commands/container-sbom) feature generates an SBOM for a container image.

Currently the only supported format is SPDX v2.3 (JSON).

An SBOM can be generated for operating system dependencies as well as [application dependencies within the image](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/use-snyk-container/detect-application-vulnerabilities-in-container-images)

## Quick Start

### If you have a cluster

1. Edit the `setenv.sh` file to set the required environment variables or ensure they are available in your environment (best practice):

```bash
vi setenv.sh
```

2. Deploy the demo:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh --demo
```

3. Run a verified deployment:

```bash
kubectl create ns sbom-demo
kubectl run verified -n sbom-demo --image=iuriikogan/snyk-juice-shop:v1.0.2
```

Expected Output: `pod/verified created`
Logs for the ratify pod in gatekeeper-system namespace will show:
```markdown
{
    "subject": "docker.io/iuriikogan/snyk-juice-shop@sha256:97e7c99eb657bcc631232b747ff7904b2fea40b7301b7c4658e62f6ec6a82dfd",
    "referenceDigest": "sha256:05149e16a75f5667d31906b1aa595c9dca6947c79a3de904292b513cbc6ea400",
    "artifactType": "application/spdx+json",
    "verifierReports": [
    {
        "isSuccess": true,
        "message": "SBOM verification success. No license or package violation found.",
        "name": "verifier-sbom",
        "verifierName": "verifier-sbom",
        "type": "sbom",
        "verifierType": "sbom",
        "extensions": {
        "creationInfo": {
            "created": "2024-09-23T13:43:58Z",
            "creators": [
            "Tool: Snyk SBOM Export API v1.98.0",
            "Organization: Snyk"
            ],
            "licenseListVersion": "3.19"
        }
        }
    }
    ],
    "nestedReports": []
}
```

4. Test the unverified deployment:

```bash
kubectl run unverified -n sbom-demo --image=iuriikogan/unverified:latest
```

Expected Output:

```Markdown
Error from server (Forbidden): admission webhook "validation.gatekeeper.sh" denied the request: [ratify-constraint] Subject failed verification: docker.io/iuriikogan/unverified@sha256:97396efd3dc2971804148d21cc6a3d532cfd3212c25c10d76664eb8fc56f2878`
```

5. Clean up the environment:
```bash
./scripts/destroy.sh [--kind]
```

### If you don't have a cluster

1. Edit the `setenv.sh` file to set the required environment variables:

```bash
vi setenv.sh
```

2. Deploy the demo:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh --all
```

**Continue with step 3 above.**

## Why should I care about SBOMs?

Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) provide detailed insights into the components within software, offering transparency and accountability. As regulatory frameworks like the Cyber Resilience Act in Europe, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), and various cybersecurity standards grow increasingly stringent, ensuring compliance is critical for businesses in regulated sectors.

### How ORAS Facilitates SBOM Verification
ORAS (OCI Registry As Storage) simplifies SBOM management by allowing SBOMs to be attached directly to OCI container images as artifacts. This enables seamless integration of SBOMs into the software supply chain, ensuring that each image includes a verifiable record of its components. By associating SBOMs with images and enforcing policies that only permit the deployment of images containing SBOMs.
 
## Why Should I integrate SBOMs into my container deployment pipelines/enforce SBOMs via policy?

By integrating SBOMs into your container deployment pipelines with tools like Snyk and ORAS, you can attach SBOMs directly to your OCI images, enabling automated verification before deployment and providing an auditable trail that demonstrates compliance during security audits.

## What is ORAS?

[ORAS](https://oras.land) (OCI Registry As Storage) is an open-source project that allows users to store various types of artifacts—beyond just container images—in OCI-compliant registries. ORAS enables developers to attach additional metadata, such as SBOMs, signatures, or vulnerability scans, directly to container images by leveraging the OCI Artifact standard. This simplifies SBOM management, ensuring that the artifacts and images stored in registries have all relevant metadata in place, enhancing compliance and operational resilience.

## What is Gatekeeper?

Gatekeeper is a policy enforcement tool for Kubernetes that ensures resources comply with organizational policies. It automates policy enforcement, minimizing errors and enhancing consistency by providing immediate feedback during development.

Kubernetes’ policy enforcement is decoupled from its API server using admission controller webhooks that are triggered when resources are created, updated, or deleted. Gatekeeper acts as a validating and mutating webhook, enforcing Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) defined by the Open Policy Agent (OPA), a powerful policy engine for cloud-native environments.

## What is Ratify?

Ratify, established in 2021, is an open-source verification engine that allows users to enforce policies by verifying container images and attestations, including SBOMs and vulnerability reports. Ratify offers a pluggable framework, enabling integration with custom verification plugins.

A common use case for Ratify is integrating it with Gatekeeper as a Kubernetes policy controller. By using ORAS to attach SBOMs to OCI images and Ratify to verify these SBOMs, organizations can automate security and compliance checks in real-time, preventing the deployment of non-compliant images.
